## ✨ Why Conceptualize?

### 🧭 Visual Discovery
See all your notes as an **interactive force-directed graph**.  
Explore relationships between ideas, drag to navigate, and double-click nodes to open notes instantly.

### 🔗 Natural Linking
Connect ideas effortlessly using simple `[[double brackets]]`.  
Conceptualize auto-suggests related notes based on both text and meaning.

### 🧠 Coming Soon: AI Insight Engine
Conceptualize doesn’t just show connections—it *finds meaning in them.*

- **Automatic Topic Detection** — discover themes across your notes  
- **Cross-Domain Connections** — uncover links between unrelated projects  
- **Knowledge Trends** — see how your ideas evolve over time  
- **Insight Cards** — get surfaced suggestions that spark serendipitous discovery  

Think of it as your quiet research partner—completely local and private.

### 🔒 Private by Design
Conceptualize operates directly on your computer’s folder structure.  
No cloud, no account, no tracking. You have 100% ownership of your knowledge.

### 📝 Open by Default
Your notes are plain-text `.md` files. They’re portable, future-proof, and can be opened with any text editor—no proprietary formats, ever.

### 🗂 Structured Simplicity
Organize your notes in folders or themes.  
Drag and drop files, create nested ideas, and switch freely between list, editor, and graph views.

### 🪟 Multi-Tab Workspace
Work on multiple notes simultaneously.  
Move fluidly between editing, graph visualization, and (coming soon) the analysis dashboard.

## 🧠 Why Local + AI Matters

Other note apps sync data to the cloud.  
**Conceptualize** keeps intelligence *next to your data*—running fully on your device.  
When AI arrives, your root folder will be analyzed locally for topics, clusters, and relationships without ever exposing private text to external servers.

Your thoughts stay yours.
